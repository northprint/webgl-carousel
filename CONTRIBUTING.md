## Adding New Effects

To add a new transition effect:

1. Create a new file in `src/effects/`
2. Implement the `Effect` interface
3. Add vertex and fragment shaders
4. Register the effect in `src/effects/index.ts`
5. Add unit tests
6. Add E2E tests
7. Update documentation

Example:
```typescript
// src/effects/myEffect.ts
import { Effect } from '../types';

export const myEffect: Effect = {
  name: 'myEffect',
  uniforms: {
    progress: 0.0,
    // Add custom uniforms
  },
  vertexShader: `...`,
  fragmentShader: `...`,
};
```
